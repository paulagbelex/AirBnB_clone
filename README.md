# AirBnB clone - The console Group project

![AirBnB Logo](https://github.com/paulagbelex/AirBnB_clone/assets/117908223/d96cef53-9dfd-4703-a155-d12adb55fbeb)

## Description
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
This first step is very important because we will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

We have done the following:
* Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* Created a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* Created all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
* Created the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Created all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## The command interpreter
Our command interpreter is limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project with some of the following operations:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Installation

You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/paulagbelex/AirBnB_clone.git
```

## Execution
The shell works like this in **interactive** mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in **non-interactive** mode:
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
